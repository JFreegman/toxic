## Settings
Running Toxic for the first time creates an empty file called toxic.conf in your home configuration directory ("~/.config/tox" for Linux users). Adding options to this file allows you to enable auto-logging, change the time format (12/24 hour), and much more.
You can view our example config file [here](misc/toxic.conf.example).

## Troubleshooting
If your default prefix is "/usr/local" and you receive the following:
```
error while loading shared libraries: libtoxcore.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
you can attempt to correct it by running `sudo ldconfig`. If that doesn't work, run:
```
echo '/usr/local/lib/' | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/locallib.conf
sudo ldconfig
```
